# Translation review for every plugin revision

The English source strings and Spanish Qt catalog use the shared
`WaterNetworkTools` context. Keep algorithm IDs unchanged. Use infinitives for
actions, `Importar`/`Exportar` for file transfers, `cota` for node elevation,
and retain EPANET, PPNO, PipeSizing, XML and file extensions.

1. Run `python translation_catalog.py --update` after changing UI text. It adds
   missing literal `tr()` strings as unfinished, preserving existing translations.
   Dynamic strings (option lists and exception messages) require explicit review;
   existing entries are retained for that reason. Never automatically translate them.
2. Review all changed names, groups, parameters and help in `wnt/i18n/wnt_es.ts`.
   Complete new translations and remove their `unfinished` attribute. Review obsolete
   strings manually, including dynamically translated strings, before removing them.
3. Run `python translation_catalog.py --check`. CI runs this without QGIS.
4. Compile with Qt `lrelease wnt/i18n/wnt_es.ts -qm wnt/i18n/wnt_es.qm`.
5. In the QGIS Python environment, run `python -m pytest -q`. The revision tests
   require the compiled catalog to match every active source catalog entry and
   exercise all registered process names and groups.
6. Run `python package_wnt.py --skip-deploy`. Packaging validates and recompiles
   translations before testing. Commit both TS and QM with the plugin changes.
7. Install the resulting ZIP in a test QGIS profile, restart QGIS and review the
   Spanish Processing panel and hydrant distance selector using metre and foot CRSs.

Release 1.4.3 also updates the contact to opensource@hidronexo.com and binds
maximum hydrant separation to the input layer CRS units.
